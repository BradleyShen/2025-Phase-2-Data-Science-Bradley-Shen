### EDA Steps Taken:

Loaded the dataset and examined its structure, types, and unique values for each variable.
Plotted relationships between key variables (discount vs. profit, sales vs. profit) using scatter plots.
Explored the mapping between IDs and names for customers and products, discovered some many-to-many relationships for products name and ID.
Visualized distributions of numeric variables and categorical counts using histograms and box plots.
Analyzed trends in sales, profit, and quantity, both cumulatively by day and breakdown by month, and plotted trends by sub-category.


### Preprocessing:

Converted date columns to datetime and then to numerical format for modeling.
Applied one-hot encoding to important categorical variables (Ship Mode, Segment, Region, Sub-Category).
Removed outliers based on extreme values in sales, profit, and quantity.
Standardized and normalized numerical features: profit was standardized, sales was log-transformed and standardized, and other numeric columns such as date, quantity, discount were normalized.
Dropped columns that were IDs or too specific to avoid overfitting.
Upsampled sub-categories to have equal representation for each class.


### Interesting Findings:

Many-to-Many Relationship: Product IDs and Product Names does not exhibit a strictly one-to-one relationship, one ID can have multiple names and one name can have multiple IDs.
Imbalanced Data: The dataset is highly imbalanced in most categorical variables such as Ship Mode, Segment, Sub-Category.
Correlated variables: Order date and ship date are the most highly correlated. Quantity is positively correlated with sales, but both have only a weak correlation with profit. Discount is negatively correlated with profit, where higher discounts generally reduce profit.
Region and Sub-category effects: Discounts correlates by region, with the Central region receives the highest discounts. Sales and profit also vary significantly by sub-category, with chairs generating the most profit and tables often resulting in losses.
Cyclic Trends: There are strong cyclic seasonal trends in sales and quantity, with peaks in September, November, and December, however this trend does not exist for profit.
